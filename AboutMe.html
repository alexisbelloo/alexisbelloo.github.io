        <h1><u>Me!</u></h1>
        <p class = "big;" style="font-size: 15px;">
            Hi, I'm Alexis. I'm from Long Island, New York, and I am a
            student at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences
            at the George Washington University studying computer science
            with a double minor in music and communications. I am the
            outreach chair for the Association of Computing Machinery
            chapter at George Washington University, and the
            programs chair of the Society of Black Engineers chapter
            at the George Washington University.
            In my free time I like to work on music, learn more about
            programming, play video games, and catch up on my favorite
            Marvel super heroes!
        </p>

        <h1><u>Objectives</u></h1>
        <p style="font-size: 15px;">
            My main objectives in my career are to go into backend
development and get into a field that would involve
helping people with the use of computer science.
I also have an interest in someday getting into game
development.
        </p>
